## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Internationalization**: next-intl

### Key Directories
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `prisma/` - Database schema and migrations
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection and internationalization
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

### Authentication Flow
Uses NextAuth.js with multiple providers. Protected routes are handled via middleware that checks session status and subscription tiers.

### Subscription System
Three-tier system (Free, Pro, Max) managed through Stripe. Subscription status is stored in the database and checked via middleware for feature access control.

## Git Workflow

- `main` - Production branch
- `dev` - Development branch
- `feature/[name]` - Feature branches

Always work on feature branches and merge to `dev` first before merging to `main`.

## Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=
DATABASE_URL=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

## Testing Instructions

After each milestone, test the following:
1. Development server starts without errors
2. Authentication flow (register/login/logout)
3. Subscription upgrade/downgrade flows
4. Protected route access based on subscription
5. Internationalization switching
6. Database connectivity and operations
